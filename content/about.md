I like to read cursive. Really. Which is convenient since I study early and antebellum southern history. Periods that produced a surprising amount of documents written in cursive. As a PhD student in the Digital History program at Clemson University I am privileged to be involved with the real-life history project at Cemetery Hill as a research assistant. I have also been able to help get summer camps for middle and elementary school students started through Cemetery Hill.

I received my masters from Clemson in Spring 2024 after successfully defending my thesis [The Lost Cause of Unionism: How Greenville Became a Failed Stronghold of Unionism in Antebellum South Carolina](https://www.proquest.com/docview/3110371574/fulltextPDF/6DB032C8FE314AA6PQ/1?accountid=6167&sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses).

This site is my placeholder online. It's my space to practice writing about the things I’m learning, the things I’m thinking about and the things I want to learn and think some more about.
