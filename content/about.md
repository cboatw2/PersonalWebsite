I like to read cursive. Really. Which is convenient since I study early and antebellum southern history. Periods that produced a surprising amount of documents written in cursive. As a PhD student in the Digital History program at Clemson University I am privileged to be a research assistant with the real-life history project at Cemetery Hill. I have also had the opportunity to be involved with getting the Hidden History summer camps for middle and elementary school students started at Clemson hosted by the Cemetery Hill research project.

I received my masters from Clemson in Spring 2024 after successfully defending my thesis [The Lost Cause of Unionism: How Greenville Became a Failed Stronghold of Unionism in Antebellum South Carolina](https://www.proquest.com/docview/3110371574/fulltextPDF/6DB032C8FE314AA6PQ/1?accountid=6167&sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses).

This site is my placeholder online. It's my space to practice writing about the things I’m learning, the things I’m thinking about and the things I want to learn and think some more about.
