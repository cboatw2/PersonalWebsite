This was created as the final project for the "Digital Methods II" course at Clemson University. By examining the CSI:Dixie dataset created at the University of Georgia and focusing on the data available for South Carolina, patterns of regionality emerge. Cororners inquest documents form the basis of this dataset and provide not only information about the causes of death prevelant during the 19th century, but also the correlation between government policies and public health.
