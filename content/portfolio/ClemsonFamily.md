This project was completed as the final project for an independent study in Spring of 2025. The database was created to show the connections between people who are listed on a 1936 map of Clemson College as living in campus housing. A comparison of those people who lived on campus and are also interred at Woodland Cemetery at Cemetery Hill was created to assertain the difference between the two groups. The project utilized Airtable to create the database and R to create the network visualizations.
