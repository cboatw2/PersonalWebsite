Between my life as a student and a mother I rarely, if ever, lay my head on the pillow at night feeling that I have accomplished everything I should have that day. It doesn’t matter that my assignments are done and my children are clean and fed and my house is fairly tidy. It doesn’t matter if I’ve spent time talking to my mom or my grandmother. It doesn’t matter if my husband and I spent time actually looking at each other’s faces and hanging out. It doesn’t matter what I have done, I almost always dwell on all the things I have yet to do.

But I’m doing some heart work and head work and am determined to give myself some credit for the things I accomplish during the day. So here goes..today I made it through an entire book for a paper I’m writing and completed another page of writing in addition to adding another 7 names to my research for work. I also tackled organizing my daughter’s closet, no small feat. I miraculously remembered to water my flowers on the front porch and introduced our 8 week old kittens to their new collars. I also signed two of my kids up for music lessons and helped my youngest complete her first little project for 3rd grade. I went through a bunch of emails and sent some follow up emails that I’ve been neglecting. I also got through a few episodes of Season 2 of the Rings of Power series on Prime. Which I love. And lest I forget…I had to take a crash course in WordPress (again) to get this up.

So, probably not the world’s most productive day, but also, not too shabby, right? I am grateful for my life and for good health and energy to accomplish what I did today. I am thankful for my family and for the opportunity to be a part of their lives. I am thankful to be a student and to have the incredible opportunity to learn and to stretch myself to accomplish hard tasks. Tomorrow is new day.
