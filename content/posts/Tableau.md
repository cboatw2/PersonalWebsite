 I got super excited about Tableau during our class with Matt Chambers who is a RCID PhD student here at Clemson. It may have had a little to do with the Tableau visualization that he created for the play-by-play Clemson v Alabama 2017 National Championship game that ended with the forever enshrined Philippians 4:13 pass. But I was also excited about the incredibly rich and varied visualization possibilities available with Tableau. Now, I had done the class reading and understood that data preparation was key to correct visualizations in Tableau. I heard Matt say that getting the data into the correct format for Tableau to read was probably one of the most difficult steps of the process. But was I deterred from jumping in with both feet and creating my own dataset to try and predict who the winner of Season 10 of The Great British Baking Show was going to be on the Friday following our Wednesday Tableau class? No! I was not!

I started by creating two separate Excel sheets. One for tracking the bakers that had won Star Baker through all the previous seasons of the show and another one for tracking bakers that had received the coveted Hollywood Handshake. I have to admit that I spent quite a bit of time tracking down all this information, but I loved it because I have religiously watched every season of The Great British Baking Show since I had to stay up late on Sunday to watch it on PBS.

So committed was I to this project that I refused to watch the finale of the show until I could use Tableau to make my prediction (yes, I know…this is a fatal error). When I finally had my dataset ready I excitedly opened Tableau and proceeded to drag in both of the Excel sheets when I hit my first “uh oh” moment. It asked me to assign connections to the sheets. I emerged several hours later more confused than when I began.

These “uh oh” moments continued on for a few days (by this time I had caved and watched the finale – congratulations Syabira!). It wasn’t until I pulled back and only played with one sheet at a time that I began to see anything that resembled usable visualization.

Now, I’m fairly certain I could have created something like this just using Excel, but it felt like a victory, so I kept working at it and finally ended up with the following.

I have no idea if I could have actually used Tableau to accurately predict the winner of The Great British Baking Show but it was definitely useful to go through this exercise. If for no other reason than realizing how much more I would need to learn to create Matt Chambers’ level Tableau visualizations.
