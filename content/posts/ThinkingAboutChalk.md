My grandfather was a high school history teacher. He had to write with chalk…Promethean boards didn’t exist. I don’t remember this personally because he had retired by the time I was a kid, but my mom used to tell me that his hands would get so dry from using the chalk that they would crack and bleed. Sometimes during class. So, here’s my grandfather, the kindest and most patient man I have ever met, bleeding in order to make it possible for his students to copy down notes and be better informed human beings.

It makes me think about all the sacrifices that teachers make for their students. Late night grading sessions. After school tutoring with a struggling student. Getting dragged into other responsibilities like coaching Lacrosse or directing the fifth grade play because no one else is available. Teachers are pretty amazing. But their biggest contributions in the classroom – their lectures – are just chalk on the board. It gets erased before the next class. Their hard work, their blood and sweat, just vanishes.

My grandfather graduated to his eternal home last year. His students still cherish him and his sacrifices for them. His contributions to this world can never be erased.
