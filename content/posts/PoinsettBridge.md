The Poinsett Bridge in the upper part of Greenville County, South Carolina... 

That's all I typed...

All that follows was autopopulated from just those 12 words...

It got a little nuts at the end, but it was on a roll there for a minute. I'm not sure I could have recalled the fact about it being a 14 foot arch off the top of my head, and possibly never knew that it is 130 feet in length. AI is wild, folks!
