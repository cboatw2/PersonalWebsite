Tropy is a desktop application developed by a group of faculty and students at George Mason University (the same group that created Zotero which I reviewed in a previous blog post). It is designed to allow users to save, organize, and mark-up images of primary source research materials. It is a beautifully simple and amazingly intuitive system. I found the tagging feature to be especially helpful because it is so customizable to your specific project as well as your personal research style. The video below is a quick demo of the filter by tag function.

Tropy
Tropy is a desktop application developed by a group of faculty and students at George Mason University (the same group that created Zotero which I reviewed in a previous blog post). It is designed to allow users to save, organize, and mark-up images of primary source research materials. It is a beautifully simple and amazingly intuitive system. I found the tagging feature to be especially helpful because it is so customizable to your specific project as well as your personal research style. The video below is a quick demo of the filter by tag function.

One of my classmates shared that he had used the option to color code his tags and then even changed the background of some of his images to match their respective tag’s color. I thought that would be great way to present Tropy for new users to make it more visually apparent what the tool does.

One thing I learned while going through the process of uploading the images into Tropy is that it’s best not to save a thumbnail or smaller image to your computer and then upload that into Tropy. I saved several smaller sized images and then realized that once they were in Tropy I wasn’t able to zoom in without losing the clarity of the image. I then replaced the images with larger ones (which I opened in a new tab) and it corrected the issue.

One of the tasks we worked through for class was using the image correction tools. It took me a minute to locate that menu but once I found it (in the top left corner) it has lots of powerful photo editing tools.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/images/Tropy1.png" alt="Unedited source" style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
  <img src="/images/Tropy2.png" alt="Edit button in Tropy" style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
  <img src="/images/Tropy3.png" alt="Editing Options" style="width: 30%; height: auto;">
</div>

In summary, Tropy is a super simple and beautiful platform for organizing and editing images with the capacity of storing notes on a single image, group of images or even a highlighted section of an individual image. I’m so glad to have this tool for use in primary source research.
