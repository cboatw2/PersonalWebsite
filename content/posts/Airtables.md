If nothing else, beginning to trying and use Airtables for census data convinced me of the absolute necessity for collaboration across multiple academic fields as history scholars. I might be good at looking at census data and understanding the narrative I’m trying to tell with the information I’m seeing, but ask me to map out a database system to create a working digital model of the data and I am in the weeds.

I tried to find some additional online resources for using Airtables outside of business or project management applications and, frankly, it’s scarce. The best one I found was on familylocket.com which is a blog and podcast created by a mother-daughter professional genealogist team. They use Airtables to track their research projects. I am still not convinced that I’m getting a really good understanding of best practices for linked data sheets and junction tables, but it still felt like a better model to follow than any of the other explanations I saw that were focused on CRM management or invoice creation.

As a platform, though, Airtables is super beautiful and easy to navigate. I just think for the initial planning stage, especially if I was wanting to, say, I don’t know, track census data over multiple census years, I would need a better understanding of linked data or to collaborate with someone who does.
