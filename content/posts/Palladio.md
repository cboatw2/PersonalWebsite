Palladio has a similar feel to Voyant as a “plug and play” web-based tool. It’s dashboard is so simple that initially it feels like you might have missed a step in the instructions. But, once you start exploring some of it’s capabilities and looking at projects in which its utilized it’s really an impressive digital research tool.

The first step is to upload your database. We used a Excel spreadsheet that contains two columns: author name and keyword. The spreadsheet was created by our Digital History instructor, Dr. Seefeldt, for a Buffalo Bill project he worked on.

Then you click ‘Load’. The image below shows the first screen that appears which includes a summary of the data I’ve uploaded.

For this exercise we were creating a word graph (instead of a map) so we clicked ‘Graph’ in the top menu. From that screen you need to open the Settings menu (highlighted purple below). You then choose your Source and Target from their respective drop-down menus. For our exercise we choose the author name as the source and the keyword as the target. A good trick that we discussed in class was to select the ‘Size nodes’ options (highlighted orange below) because it will increase the size of the node according to frequency of occurrence.

Then Palladio creates the beautiful graph below allowing you to see what words did and did not overlap between these two authors.

I am looking forward to getting to know Palladio better, especially creating maps using research data. I’m also wondering if Voyant would be a useful tool to create datasets to use in conjunction with Palladio.
