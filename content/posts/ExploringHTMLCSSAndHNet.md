Exploring HTML, CSS and H-Net
We had the opportunity to learn about and do some hands-on exercises with HTML and CSS in my Digital Methods class this week. We started with HTML in Codeacademy and I was amazed how quickly those concepts gelled. I think that it took us all longer to access the tutorial than it did getting the hang of the commands. Also, I have also never been so thankful to have taken a Java class in high school and could still hear my sweet teacher’s voice in my head…”Did you remember to close that section?”.

Codeacademy is an awesome platform to learn in. I especially like the option to show the solution code because it compares the code you’ve written with the correct version so you can see exactly where you went wrong.

CSS feels more intimidating even though the actual code is very similar to HTML, but I’m excited to learn more about it since it saves having to edit each individual element and also produces the “cool” effects on a webpage rather than just populating it with HTML.

Finally, we were able to create H-Net accounts and beginning exploring that platform. It’s really amazing that sites like this exist for historians and history students to be able to network with people that you may not otherwise find on the web or social media or connect with in-person. I’ve subscribed to the following networks and have already received some really interesting content from a few of them!
