I believe that the inscription above the entrance to every college and university History Department should be sandblasted and replaced with ‘Zotero – Citations Simplified’. I mean, seriously, in one thousand years when our ancestors are trying to piece together the remnants of our digital age I, for one, would love for them to know that whatever mistakes we made, we at least figured out how to automate citing secondary source materials in our historical research papers.

We had the privilege of having Clemson’s Dr. Joshua Catalano come to our Digital Methods class and demo several amazing features in Zotero. He was at George Mason when they were first developing Zotero and was on the team that tested and troubleshot the system (for which they granted him an unlimited amount of storage on Zotero for life…not a bad trade!). I also stole the title of this blog post from him. One of the coolest things he said during his presentation (and he said a lot of really cool things) was that he wrote his entire doctoral dissertation using Google Docs and Zotero. Proving again that using simple tools well is just as effective, if not more so, than incorrectly using the Swiss Army tools incorrectly or ineffectively – even in the land of technology.

I feel that one of the most powerful tools in Zotero for me will be the tagging function. It allows searching for user assigned keywords across the user’s entire library. So, if I read an article about coffee importing statistics in 18th century France and save it in a “European Colonial Trading Routes” file but then want to access it for research on a different topic I will be able to search for the tag I’ve assigned it without having to remember what file I stored it in.

I will also be setting up a file that was suggested on the Zotero Support page (pictured left) where I will store articles/books that I need to read or read more thoroughly before I save them to their permanent file location.
