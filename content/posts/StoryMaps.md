Last week after doing the reading about StoryMaps for my Digital History class I wrote in my reflection that I was interested in learning more about other platforms that would be able to handle more complex narratives in a digital space. I would like to say that I stand well and truly corrected. For some reason (lets just blame it on sleep deprivation, shall we?) I was remembering StoryMaps from the summer GIS workshop I attended as only able to produce very simple online maps with narrative overlay and, boy, do I feel silly now!

What the good people at Esri have given us in StoryMaps is a way to create interactive, visually stunning stories against the backdrop of their absolutely mind-blowing mapping technology that engages an audience in an entirely different way than we’re able to do with just narrative. It has so many visualization tools and it is so user-friendly. I think my favorite feature is the ability to add an image simply by copying the image’s link. It saves having to download the image to your desktop and then adding it to your story.

StoryMaps, for me, allows us to engage a broader audience with our historic narratives. I probably am not going to be able to get my or kids to sit down and read a paper I’ve written about a subject they’re not interested in, but if I sent them a link to a StoryMap that they can scroll through and interact with I will at least succeed in introducing them to the topic in an accessible and fun way and they might even learn a little about what I’ve been researching. And what more could we really ask for?
