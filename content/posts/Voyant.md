I chose to use Jacob Taubes’ Occidental Eschatology as my corpus in Voyant. Because the only version I had was a PDF of a photocopy of the book, the first time I uploaded it Voyant wasn’t able to recognize any of the text. I ran it through Adobe’s OCR feature and uploaded that and most of the text became readable for Voyant. The image below shows the first word cloud that was generated for the text after performing OCR.

When I originally wrote this post for my WordPress blog I cleaned up the text to removed the OCR errors and then generated a new word cloud. Unfortunately, I didn't take a screenshot and instead linked directly to Voyant. Because Voyant doesn't require an account, it also doesn't save your corpus or any of the visualizations you create.

I also found the Trends visualization to really useful for analyzing the text.

A few things I struggled with:

- If I closed the Voyant tab I wasn’t able to go back and access the corpus I was previously working in. I had this trouble even after I installed Voyant onto my desktop (which was another struggle all together).
- The URL’s I exported from Voyant and then linked in WordPress never worked correctly so I had to export HTML and link it that way to create an interactive image.
- I did figure out that if you mouse over the top menu bar (blue) you’re able to go to a full-screen view of whatever tool you’re wanting to utilize. At first I was resizing all of the screens in corpus view in order to make one larger. You can then go back to corpus view on the main menu in order to see your corpus “dashboard”.

In summary, Voyant is an amazing text visualization tool. I am planning on uploading other works by Taubes to create a true corpus and using that in my research for my final paper for Historical Methods and Thinking.
