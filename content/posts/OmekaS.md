Omeka S is an open-source platform that allows users to create a digital exhibit on the front end and populate the individual items’ back-end with metadata that allows the exhibit to connect with other online resources and researchers.

We installed Omeka through our Reclaim Hosting site and then selected three images of a Clemson University building/space along with supporting materials from The Tiger (Clemson’s newspaper), TAPS (Clemson’s yearbook) and Board of Trustee’s minutes. I received an error message while loading my first images. Once I entered “/usr/bin” into the ImageMagick Directory Path in Settings my images and their thumbnails loaded correctly.

In the Omeka S manual the first suggestion is to plan out the project before beginning. I would add that it would be helpful to have a greater understanding of the metadata fields that are available in Omeka before beginning to look at your sources. It would have been much easier to know what to look for in the sources rather than trying to populate the metadata after the fact.

I am looking forward working with Omeka more and gaining a better understanding of metadata as well as using it as a presentation tool.
