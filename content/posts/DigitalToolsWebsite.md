Well, this is it! The culmination of the work that I’ve done this semester in my Digital Methods class at Clemson. If you had told me going into this class that I would build not one, but two WordPress sites I wouldn’t have believed you. And really, building the WordPress sites was a sidenote to all of the technology we were introduced to and had the opportunity to work with!

I cannot believe the amount of confidence that this semester has given me about moving forward into a career as a professional historian. I was introduced to so many other opportunities that are available within the historical profession outside of teaching and had the opportunity to learn the theoretical implications of the digital turn as well as to work with various technology platforms. All of this has really motivated me to explore what may be possible outside of the traditional academic route and I can’t wait to see where this new road will lead!
