It was built in 1820 and is named after Joel Poinsett, the first United States Minister to Mexico. The bridge includes a 14-foot Gothic arch and stretches 130 feet over Little Gap Creek. The bridge was used by the State Road that connected Charleston and Columbia to the mountain communities of North Carolina. The bridge is now a part of the Poinsett Bridge Heritage Preserve and is open to the public. The bridge is a popular spot for photographers and hikers. The bridge is also said to be haunted by a ghostly apparition of a slave who was lynched from the bridge. The bridge is a popular spot for photographers and hikers.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, this is it! The culmination of the work that I’ve done this semester in my Digital Methods class at Clemson. If you had told me going into this class that I would build not one, but two WordPress sites I wouldn’t have believed you. And really, building the WordPress sites was a sidenote to all of the technology we were introduced to and had the opportunity to work with!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tableau...maybe not as simple as it appears?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/tableau/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got super excited about Tableau during our class with Matt Chambers who is a RCID PhD student here at Clemson. It may have had a little to do with the Tableau visualization that he created for the play-by-play Clemson v Alabama 2017 National Championship game that ended with the forever enshrined Philippians 4:13 pass. But I was also excited about the incredibly rich and varied visualization possibilities available with Tableau. Now, I had done the class reading and understood that data preparation was key to correct visualizations in Tableau. I heard Matt say that getting the data into the correct format for Tableau to read was probably one of the most difficult steps of the process. But was I deterred from jumping in with both feet and creating my own dataset to try and predict who the winner of Season 10 of The Great British Baking Show was going to be on the Friday following our Wednesday Tableau class? No! I was not!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Palladio</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Palladio has a similar feel to Voyant as a “plug and play” web-based tool. It’s dashboard is so simple that initially it feels like you might have missed a step in the instructions. But, once you start exploring some of it’s capabilities and looking at projects in which its utilized it’s really an impressive digital research tool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first step is to upload your database. We used a Excel spreadsheet that contains two columns: author name and keyword. The spreadsheet was created by our Digital History instructor, Dr. Seefeldt, for a Buffalo Bill project he worked on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Voyant</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I chose to use Jacob Taubes’ Occidental Eschatology as my corpus in Voyant. Because the only version I had was a PDF of a photocopy of the book, the first time I uploaded it Voyant wasn’t able to recognize any of the text. I ran it through Adobe’s OCR feature and uploaded that and most of the text became readable for Voyant. The image below shows the first word cloud that was generated for the text after performing OCR.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I would like to say that I stand well and truly corrected. For some reason (lets just blame it on sleep deprivation, shall we?) I was remembering StoryMaps from the summer GIS workshop I attended as only able to produce very simple online maps with narrative overlay and, boy, do I feel silly now!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Airtables for Census Data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, beginning to try and use Airtables for census data convinced me of the absolute necessity for collaboration across multiple academic fields as history scholars. I might be good at looking at census data and understanding the narrative I’m trying to tell with the information I’m seeing, but ask me to map out a database system to create a working digital model of the data and I am in the weeds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Omeka S is an open-source platform that allows users to create a digital exhibit on the front end and populate the individual items’ back-end with metadata that allows the exhibit to connect with other online resources and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We installed Omeka through our Reclaim Hosting site and then selected three images of a Clemson University building/space along with supporting materials from The Tiger (Clemson’s newspaper), TAPS (Clemson’s yearbook) and Board of Trustee’s minutes. I received an error message while loading my first images. Once I entered “/usr/bin” into the ImageMagick Directory Path in Settings my images and their thumbnails loaded correctly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tropy is a desktop application developed by a group of faculty and students at George Mason University (the same group that created Zotero which I reviewed in a previous blog post). It is designed to allow users to save, organize, and mark-up images of primary source research materials. It is a beautifully simple and amazingly intuitive system. I found the tagging feature to be especially helpful because it is so customizable to your specific project as well as your personal research style. The video below is a quick demo of the filter by tag function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I believe that the inscription above the entrance to every college and university History Department should be sandblasted and replaced with ‘Zotero – Citations Simplified’. I mean, seriously, in one thousand years when our ancestors are trying to piece together the remnants of our digital age I, for one, would love for them to know that whatever mistakes we made, we at least figured out how to automate citing secondary source materials in our historical research papers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;September 21, 2022&#xA;Exploring HTML, CSS and H-Net&#xA;We had the opportunity to learn about and do some hands-on exercises with HTML and CSS in my Digital Methods class this week. We started with HTML in Codeacademy and I was amazed how quickly those concepts gelled. I think that it took us all longer to access the tutorial than it did getting the hang of the commands. Also, I have also never been so thankful to have taken a Java class in high school and could still hear my sweet teacher’s voice in my head…”Did you remember to close that section?”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thinking About Chalk</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My grandfather was a high school history teacher. He had to write with chalk…Promethean boards didn’t exist. I don’t remember this personally because he had retired by the time I was a kid, but my mom used to tell me that his hands would get so dry from using the chalk that they would crack and bleed. Sometimes during class. So, here’s my grandfather, the kindest and most patient man I have ever met, bleeding in order to make it possible for his students to copy down notes and be better informed human beings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
