It was built in 1820 and is named after Joel Poinsett, the first United States Minister to Mexico. The bridge includes a 14-foot Gothic arch and stretches 130 feet over Little Gap Creek. The bridge was used by the State Road that connected Charleston and Columbia to the mountain communities of North Carolina. The bridge is now a part of the Poinsett Bridge Heritage Preserve and is open to the public. The bridge is a popular spot for photographers and hikers. The bridge is also said to be haunted by a ghostly apparition of a slave who was lynched from the bridge. The bridge is a popular spot for photographers and hikers.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a Java reference implementation of dynamic event-driven actors runtime aiming at providing adequate abstraction levels and mechanisms for modelling and developing (distributed) event-based systems. DERA leverages the intrinsic loose coupling of event-driven communication styles to support various kinds of &lt;em&gt;run-time evolution and adaptation&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., enabling run-time flexibility) while &lt;em&gt;minimizing the non-deterministic nature of traditional event-based applications&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., supporting formal analysis).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/htr3n/triple-hyde&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;triple-hyde&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a responsive &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; theme inspired by @spf13&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/spf13/hyde.git&#34;&gt;Hyde&lt;/a&gt; and its variant &lt;a href=&#34;https://npf.io&#34;&gt;Nate Finch&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt;. It was heavily restructured with modularised page layouts for easier maintenance and modification. &lt;em&gt;triple-hyde&lt;/em&gt; offers awesome features such as nice colour tone, &lt;a href=&#34;https://highlightjs.org&#34;&gt;code highlighting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fontawesome.com&#34;&gt;Font-Awesome 5&amp;rsquo;s sidebar icons&lt;/a&gt;), a cool portfolio page, more choices for commenting (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://graphcomment.com&#34;&gt;GraphComment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://disqus.com&#34;&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/htr3n/laramod&#34;&gt;LaraMod&lt;/a&gt; is another modularisation effort to systematically organising a &lt;a href=&#34;https://laravel.com&#34;&gt;Laravel&lt;/a&gt; based project. The idea stems from my struggle to structure a Laravel-based project so that I can work effectively on individual modules whilst keeping Laravel codebase intact as much as possible and also keeping the project&amp;rsquo;s codebase separate from Laravel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like to read cursive. Really. Which is convenient since I study early and antebellum southern history. Periods that produced a surprising amount of documents written in cursive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why isn&amp;rsquo;t anything changing? It is. Just nothing that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
