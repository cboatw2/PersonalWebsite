<p>The Poinsett Bridge in the upper part of Greenville County, South Carolina&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I typed&hellip;</p>

<p>AUTO-GENERATED BY AI &ldquo;&hellip;is the oldest bridge in South Carolina. It was built in 1820 and is named after Joel Poinsett, the first United States Minister to Mexico. The bridge includes a 14-foot Gothic arch and stretches 130 feet over Little Gap Creek. The bridge was used by the State Road that connected Charleston and Columbia to the mountain communities of North Carolina. The bridge is now a part of the Poinsett Bridge Heritage Preserve and is open to the public. The bridge is a popular spot for photographers and hikers. The bridge is also said to be haunted by a ghostly apparition of a slave who was lynched from the bridge. The bridge is a popular spot for photographers and hikers.

        <p>I stepped out onto my back porch around 10:00 to watch the wind and rain continue to billow as Hurricane Helene moved through my area in the Upstate of South Carolina. We lost electricity around 6:30 that morning, but I had the coffee made so it didn’t feel desperate. Then the phone and therefore browsing service got spotty and eventually disappeared. Desperate is a relative term. One of our trees had fallen onto our fence and into our neighbors yard and I dreaded assessing the damage. My dad was out of town leaving my mom at their house on her own. I worried about the water rising on their property. I wondered how much longer the charges on our phones would last. I couldn’t get on the power company’s website to see if there was an estimated restoration time. Were our relatives in Georgia doing alright? Had my friend Sally’s trees near her house come down in the wind? Was the playdate my daughter had planned with her soccer teammates for this afternoon going to be able to happen? What if power didn’t come back on for days? How long does food last in a freezer without electricity? What about the research I had planned for the day? What about the assignments I had due? Why hadn’t I ordered more of the books I needed to read for my classes? Why hadn’t I made the kids shower last night? Were any of my texts even getting through?</p>

        <p>Between my life as a student and a mother I rarely, if ever, lay my head on the pillow at night feeling that I have accomplished everything I should have that day. It doesn’t matter that my assignments are done and my children are clean and fed and my house is fairly tidy. It doesn’t matter if I’ve spent time talking to my mom or my grandmother. It doesn’t matter if my husband and I spent time actually looking at each other’s faces and hanging out. It doesn’t matter what I have done, I almost always dwell on all the things I have yet to do.</p>

<p>In Elise Lathrop’s 1926 book, Early American Inns and Taverns, she states that there were not many old inns in South Carolina. She defines ‘old’ as at least 100 years old from the time of her writing. She mentions a few old inns, sometimes called ‘ordinaries’ in the south, in and around Charleston, but only one in the upstate of South Carolina. It was on the stagecoach road than ran from Greenville, SC to Augusta, GA.</p>

        <p>Well, this is it! The culmination of the work that I’ve done this semester in my Digital Methods class at Clemson. If you had told me going into this class that I would build not one, but two WordPress sites I wouldn’t have believed you. And really, building the WordPress sites was a sidenote to all of the technology we were introduced to and had the opportunity to work with!</p>

        <p>I got super excited about Tableau during our class with Matt Chambers who is a RCID PhD student here at Clemson. It may have had a little to do with the Tableau visualization that he created for the play-by-play Clemson v Alabama 2017 National Championship game that ended with the forever enshrined Philippians 4:13 pass. But I was also excited about the incredibly rich and varied visualization possibilities available with Tableau. Now, I had done the class reading and understood that data preparation was key to correct visualizations in Tableau. I heard Matt say that getting the data into the correct format for Tableau to read was probably one of the most difficult steps of the process. But was I deterred from jumping in with both feet and creating my own dataset to try and predict who the winner of Season 10 of The Great British Baking Show was going to be on the Friday following our Wednesday Tableau class? No! I was not!</p>

        <p>Palladio has a similar feel to Voyant as a “plug and play” web-based tool. It’s dashboard is so simple that initially it feels like you might have missed a step in the instructions. But, once you start exploring some of it’s capabilities and looking at projects in which its utilized it’s really an impressive digital research tool.</p>
<p>The first step is to upload your database. We used a Excel spreadsheet that contains two columns: author name and keyword. The spreadsheet was created by our Digital History instructor, Dr. Seefeldt, for a Buffalo Bill project he worked on.</p>

        <p>I chose to use Jacob Taubes’ Occidental Eschatology as my corpus in Voyant. Because the only version I had was a PDF of a photocopy of the book, the first time I uploaded it Voyant wasn’t able to recognize any of the text. I ran it through Adobe’s OCR feature and uploaded that and most of the text became readable for Voyant. The image below shows the first word cloud that was generated for the text after performing OCR.</p>
