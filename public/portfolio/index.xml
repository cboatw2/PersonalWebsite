      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project was completed as the final project for an independent study in Spring of 2025. The database was created to show the connections between people who are listed on a 1936 map of Clemson College as living in campus housing. A comparison of those people who lived on campus and are also interred at Woodland Cemetery at Cemetery Hill was created to assertain the difference between the two groups. The project utilized Airtable to create the database and R to create the network visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

By examining the CSI:Dixie dataset created at the University of Georgia and focusing on the data available for South Carolina, patterns of regionality emerge. Cororners inquest documents form the basis of this dataset and provide not only information about the causes of death prevelant during the 19th century, but also the correlation between government policies and public health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
